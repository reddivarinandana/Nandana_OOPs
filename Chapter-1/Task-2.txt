2 . Extending your Swiss journey to neighboring countries, such as Italy requires adapting your travel 
checklist to address the specific requirement.This adaptation closely relates to the concepts of
inheritance and polymorphism.

Inheritance :
    In Java, you begin by making a basic checklist (the base class) that has shared items and 
    instructions. Then, you make other checklists (derived classes) that inherit from it, customizing
    them for specific purposes. These customized checklists can either add new things or change 
    existing ones to meet the particular needs of your trip. So, inheritance in Java is like
    expanding and adjusting a base checklist to make specialized checklists.

Base CheckList : 
    1 . Passport
    2 . Tickets
    3 . Clothing
    4 . Toiletries
    5 . Universal power adapter (suitable for European sockets)
    6 . Medications and prescriptions
    7 . Basic clothing items (weather-appropriate)
    8 . Local map and guidebook
    9 . Emergency contact information

Italy Checklist (Subclass of Base Checklist):
    1 . 
    2 . Euros (currency)
    3 . Local SIM card 
    4 . Dining and food recommendations
    5 . Specific destinations and attractions 

polymorphism : 
    Polymorphism in Java allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class, 
providing multiple implementations of a function that can be accessed through a common interface. It 
enables flexibility and the ability to interact with objects consistently, even when their 
implementations differ.

Polymorphism in Action:
    Polymorphism allows you to interact with the items on both the base checklist and the Italy 
checklist consistently, even though the implementations may differ. 
For example:

Checking Passport: 
    Whether you're checking your passport for Switzerland or Italy, you use the same action and 
verification process, which remains consistent.

Packing Clothing: 
    Regardless of the destination's weather, the process of packing clothing remains consistent. 
Polymorphism ensures that the method for packing clothing can be implemented differently for each 
destination but is accessed through a common interface.

Using a Universal Power Adapter: 
    The action of using a universal power adapter is the same, even though the socket standards 
in Europe may vary. The implementation details (e.g., plug shape) can differ, but the common 
interface (using the adapter) remains the same.

Handling Currency (Polymorphism) : 
    Whether you're dealing with Swiss Francs in Switzerland or Euros in Italy, you're interacting 
with the concept of currency in a consistent way. Different currencies are treated as instances of a 
common currency interface, allowing for flexibility and uniformity in your financial transactions.
